# css-toggle

A component that can toggle light/dark theme's and change colour schemes for the entire app. The users system preferences are taken into consideration.

Theme's are applied through CSS variables stored in the themes.css file.

Colour combinations are fully accessible and are available at https://randoma11y.com/?color=blue.

This is just a proof of concept and shouldn't be used in production.
